## Helper module for loading, merging and saving fixture files
# Uses the Yaml include monkey patch.
module Helpers
  module Fixtures
    # The fixture helper will automatically load fixtures for scenarios
    # based on their tags. A fixture tag is a tag prefixed with @fixture_
    # anything after the underscore will be used as the basename for
    # the fixture you want loaded.
    #
    # Fixture files are loaded using a "basename", this base name is used
    # in a MagicPath and resolved to an actual path. There are two MagicPaths
    # for fixture file names: fixture_file_base and fixture_file_env
    #
    # **fixture_file_base** defines a default fixture file. A basename of
    # 'foo' would resolve to 'foo.yml' using the default fixture_file_base
    #
    # **fixture_file_env defines** a fixture file for a specific test environment.
    # it combines the environment variable TEST_ENV with the base name.
    # For example, a TEST_ENV of 'staging' and a basename of 'foo' will
    # resolve to 'foo.staging.yml'.
    #
    # When the helper loads files, it first tries to load the enviroment
    # specific fixture file. This allows us to customize fixture data
    # for specific environments and fall back on a default for all others.
    #
    # All of the above refers to the default paths for fixture files.
    # However, since they're MagicPaths and intended to be customized
    # they may resolve to different values based on how they're configured.
    #
    # Refer to support/paths.rb for the current patterns for those two paths.
    #
    # The environment variable FIXTURE_ROOT is used as the default location
    # for fixture files. It's default value can be found in lib/nenv_vars.rb
    #
