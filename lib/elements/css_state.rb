  # Define a state engine for an existing element based on CSS classes
  #
  # The css_state method accepts another element as it's first argument
  # and then a hash containing state names and the CSS classes that represent
  # those states.  For example:
  #
  # link(:show_contacts, data_bind: /ShowContacts/)
  # css_state(:show_contacts, open: 'k-minus', closed: 'k-plus')
  #
  # Here we've defined a link called "show_contacts".
  # We've all defined two states "open" and "closed" and the CSS classes
  # associated with those states.
  #
  # With that in place we can query the state of that element with "ELEMENT_STATE?"
  # where ELEMENT is the element name and STATE is one of the states we've defined.
  # For example:
  #
  # page.show_contacts_open?
  #
  # Quite often you'll encounter elements that only have a CSS class for one
  # of their states.  In those cases you can define an additional state as the
  # absence of a class.  For example:
  #
  #
  # li(:contacts_menu_dropdown, xpath: '//*[@id="sp-navbar"]/ul/li[1]')
  # css_state(:contacts_menu_dropdown, open: 'open', closed: { not: 'open' })
  #
  # When the dropdown is open the CSS class "open" is applied.
  # When it's closed the "open" CSS class is removed, but no "closed" class appears.
  # By passing a hash with the keyword "not" we can pass a class name that should
  # be missing in order for the element to be in this state.
  #
  # @param name [Symbol] The existing element you want to create states for.
  # @param states [Hash] The states and their classes as documented above

    # Flexible way to ask if an element has, or does not have a CSS class.
    #
    # It can be called with a simple string:
    #   element.css_class_match?('foo')
    #     # Returns true if any of the CSS classes are exactly named foo
    #
    # It can be called with a regex:
    #
    #   element.css_class_match?(/foo/)
    #   # Returns true if any of the CSS classes contain the 'foo' i.e. foo_bar, foobar, myfoo
    #
    # The invert parameter inverts the meaning so:
    #
    #   element.css_class_match?('foo', true)
    #   # Returns true if NONE of the CSS classes are exactly named foo
    #
    #
    # The matcher can be a hash in the form of:
    #  { has: 'some_class' } or { not: 'some_class'}
    #
    # This is primarily used by the css_state method
    #
    # @param matcher [String, Regex, Hash] See examples
    # @param invert [Boolean] Returns true if the class does NOT exist.
